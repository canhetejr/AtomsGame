# Atom's Game

## Overview

**Atom's Game** is an educational web-based game designed to help children and teenagers learn the elements of the Periodic Table. The game challenges players to identify chemical elements based on their symbols.

The project was originally presented at the National Institute of Amazon Researchers (INPA) science fair for public school teachers and students in Manaus, AM - Brazil.

You can play the game in your browser [here](https://atomsgame.github.io/atomsgame.github.io/).

## How to Play

1.  Click the "Play" button on the splash screen.
2.  A chemical element name will appear on the left side of the screen (the "cat").
3.  Falling blocks with chemical symbols will descend from the top.
4.  **Click** on the falling block that matches the element name shown.
5.  You have **3 lives**. Selecting the wrong symbol or letting the correct symbol fall off the screen will cost you a life.
6.  The game speeds up as you score more points!
